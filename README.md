 Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends using real-world registration data. Through data visualization and statistical exploration, it offers key insights into the growth and distribution of electric vehicles, shedding light on patterns across manufacturers, cities, and model years.

The dataset originates from publicly available government records and has been explored using Python with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and impactful visual storytelling.

## Project Overview

Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly central to global sustainability efforts. This project aims to understand how EV adoption is evolving by addressing the following objectives:

- Analyze trends in EV adoption by model year to identify growth patterns.
- Determine the most popular makes and models across different regions.
- Explore the geographic distribution of EVs, highlighting cities and counties with the highest adoption rates.
- Compare electric vehicle types (e.g., Battery Electric vs. Plug-in Hybrid) and their manufacturers.
- Visualize the distribution of electric ranges and evaluate which manufacturers lead in range efficiency.
- Present a clean and visually compelling summary using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Dataset Access

Due to file size limitations, the dataset has not been uploaded directly to this repository. However, it is available for download via the following link:

Dataset : data.zip

This dataset includes detailed records on EV type, make, model year, electric range, city, county, and more, enabling a wide scope of analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

The project has been developed using:

- Python (3.x)
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
- openpyxl for reading Excel files (if working with `.xlsx`)
- Jupyter Notebook or IDLE as the development environment

## Running the Project

To reproduce the analysis on your own system:

1. Clone the repository:
